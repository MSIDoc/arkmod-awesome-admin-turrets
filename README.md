# arkmod-awesome-admin-turrets
ARK: Survival Evolved - MOD for Awesome Admin Turret structures.

**Awesome Admin Turrets require NO electricity to turn on.  They consume NO bullets as they fire.  They do FATAL damage per shot.**

One turret will 1-shot a wild giga.  Anything that comes in range of this turret will be dead, with no ability to react to it.

To spawn one for yourself (single player mode)

`cheat giveitem "Blueprint'/Game/Mods/AwesomeAdminTurretMod/PrimalItemStructure_AwesomeAdminTurret.PrimalItemStructure_AwesomeAdminTurret'" 1 1 0`

On a dedicated server, use `admincheat` instead of `cheat`.
